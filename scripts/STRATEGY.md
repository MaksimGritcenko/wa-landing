## Step 1: Review and Prioritize Leads

After running `npm run export`, you'll have a CSV file with qualified leads.

### Prioritization Criteria:

1. **Lead Score** (highest first)
   - Score ≥ 12: Urgent - Major issues affecting revenue
   - Score 9-11: High priority - Significant improvement potential
   - Score 7-8: Medium priority - Good opportunities

2. **Email Availability**
   - Leads with verified email addresses
   - Business emails > Generic emails (info@, contact@)

3. **Industry Match**
   - Industries you have experience with
   - Industries with higher budgets (SaaS, Healthcare, Legal, Finance)

4. **Location** (if targeting specific markets)

---

## Step 2: Segment Your Leads

Create 3 segments:

### Tier 1: Hot Leads (Score ≥ 12)
- Send within 24 hours
- Offer free detailed audit report
- Emphasize urgency (losing conversions daily)

### Tier 2: Warm Leads (Score 9-11)
- Send within 1 week
- Focus on specific high-impact fixes
- Offer free consultation call

### Tier 3: Long-term Nurture (Score 7-8)
- Add to email list for weekly tips
- Reach out quarterly
- Share relevant case studies

---

## Step 3: Personalization Checklist

Before sending each email, customize:

✅ **Business Name** - Use actual business name, not domain
✅ **Specific Issues** - Pick 2-3 most relevant issues from audit
✅ **Industry Context** - Mention industry-specific impact
✅ **Social Proof** - Add relevant case study if available
✅ **Call-to-Action** - Clear next step (call, report, demo)

---

## Step 4: Multi-Channel Approach

### Channel Priority:

1. **Email** (Primary)
   - Business hours: Tuesday-Thursday, 10 AM - 2 PM
   - Subject line: Specific, not salesy
   - Body: 3-5 sentences max

2. **LinkedIn** (Secondary)
   - Connect first with personalized note
   - Wait 3-5 days, then send message
   - Reference their profile/recent posts

3. **Phone** (For high-value leads only)
   - Call after email (2-3 days later)
   - Reference the email sent
   - Keep it brief (2 minutes max)

---

## Step 5: Email Sequence

### Email 1: Initial Outreach (Day 0)
```
